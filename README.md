# Google ZX starter

Repository with an ZX example and some TS globals for VS Code

## Usage

Fork this repo so that you can add your own scripts.

Install [ZX](https://github.com/google/zx) globally:

```shell
npm i -g zx
```

then install it locally for types (only if you need that for your editor)

```
npm i
```

Run the example script:

```sh
zx ./hello-world.mjs
```

Have fun!
